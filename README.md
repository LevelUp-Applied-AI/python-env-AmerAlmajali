When you would choose a Jupyter notebook over a script?

I would choose Jupyter Notebook when I need to experiment or test. It gives me the ability to write full descriptions alongside my code. Additionally, I can run each cell independently, so I can test each command alone and try different approaches.

When you would choose a script over a notebook?
I would choose a Python script when I just want to upload a Python code that I am certain will run. In this case, I do not need to check any part of the code separately.Additonally,
when i need the code to be clear and the interactivity was not required.
